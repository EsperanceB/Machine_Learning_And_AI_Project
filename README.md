# Machine_Learning_And_AI_Project
This repo will host my all my practical skills related to ML and AI

As I'm advancing in my career transitioning, I don't have a better way to showcase my commitment other than documenting on it.
On this place, I will report on my past and recent achievements towards my AWS Machine Learning Engineer path from elementary labs to my own designed projects.
If your read until here, I appreciate your time and hopefully, this will help someone out there who's like me transitioning.

# Machine_Learning_And_AI_Project

As I'm advancing in my career transitioning towards becoming a Machine Learning Engineer, I don't have a better way to showcase my commitment other than documenting on it.
On this place, I will report on my past and recent achievements towards my AWS Machine Learning Engineer career path from elementary labs to my own designed projects.
If you've read until here, I appreciate your time, thank you.
